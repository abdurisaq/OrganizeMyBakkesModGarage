### Additional Informations

* This plugin works on both epic games and steam
* This plugin does not currently work with Linux and will probably crash upon opening.
* Currently, it is not compatible with alphaconsole custom decals
* As a note, if you want it to swap car bodies, make sure you atleast have one in-game preset with said car body
* Updating the bakkesmod preset doesn't automatically update the preset saved in a group, you need to add and remove it from the group for it to update
